## üöÄ Quick Start

Launch the application directly from your terminal:

```
bitchat-tui
```

The app will immediately start scanning for other BitChat users. Once a peer is found, it will connect automatically and you'll be placed in the `#public` chat room.

Type messages in the input box and press `Enter` to send. Use `/help` to see a list of all available commands.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure & Anonymous**: All communication is end-to-end encrypted. No phone number, email, or account is required. Your identity is ephemeral and tied only to your session keys.
- **Peer-to-Peer Mesh**: Communicates directly with other devices running the app over Bluetooth Low Energy. No internet connection or central server is needed.
- **Public & Private Channels**: Chat with everyone in the public room, or create/join private, password-protected channels for group conversations.
- **Direct Messaging (DMs)**: Engage in secure, one-to-one conversations with any user on the network.
- **User & Channel Lists**: The sidebar provides an at-a-glance view of online users and the channels you've joined.
- **Message Fragmentation**: Large messages are automatically split into smaller chunks and reassembled by the receiving client, ensuring reliable delivery.
- **Cross-Platform**: A single binary that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## üéÆ TUI Navigation

The Terminal User Interface is designed for intuitive keyboard-only operation.

### Key Bindings

- **`Tab`**: Switch focus between the **Sidebar**, **Main Panel**, and **Input Box**.
- **`‚Üë` / `‚Üì`**: Navigate lists in the sidebar or scroll through messages in the main panel.
- **`Enter`**:
    - In **Sidebar**: Select a channel/user to chat with, or expand/collapse a section.
    - In **Input Box**: Send your message or command.
- **`Ctrl+C`**: Exit the application.
- **`PgUp` / `PgDn`**: Page up/down through the chat history in the main panel.
- **`Home` / `End`**: Jump to the start/end of the chat history.
- **`r`** (on error screen): Attempt to reconnect.

## üíª In-App Commands

Type these commands into the input box to manage your chat experience.

### Basic Commands
- **`/help`**: Displays a list of all available commands.
- **`/name <new_name>`**: Changes your nickname for the current session.
- **`/exit`**: Quits the application.

### Channel Management
- **`/j #<channel> [password]`**: Joins a channel. If the channel is password-protected, provide the password.
- **`/leave`**: Leaves the current channel and returns you to `#public`.
- **`/pass <password>`**: Sets a password for a channel you created.
- **`/channels`**: Lists all channels you have discovered or joined.

### User Interaction
- **`/dm <user>`**: Starts a private Direct Message with a specific user.
- **`/online`**: Lists all users currently visible on the network.
- **`/block <user>`**: Blocks all messages from a specific user.
- **`/unblock <user>`**: Unblocks a previously blocked user.
- **`/clear`**: Clears all messages from the current conversation view.

## üîê Cryptography & Security

BitChat is built with security and privacy as a first principle. All communication is protected by a modern cryptographic stack.

### Key Exchange
- **X25519**: Ephemeral keys are generated for each session. The X25519 algorithm is used for an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to establish a secure, shared secret with each peer.

### Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**: All messages (public, channel, and DM) are encrypted using AES in Galois/Counter Mode with a 256-bit key derived from the shared secret. This provides both confidentiality and integrity.

### Authentication
- **Ed25519**: Each peer generates an ephemeral Ed25519 key pair to sign communications, ensuring that messages are authentic and originate from the claimed sender.

### Channel Passwords
- **PBKDF2-SHA256**: When you set a password for a channel, a symmetric key is derived from it using PBKDF2 with 100,000 rounds of HMAC-SHA256, making it computationally difficult to brute-force.

## üéØ Use Cases

BitChat is perfect for any situation where you need to communicate without relying on internet infrastructure.
- **Public Events**: Create a local chat network at concerts, festivals, or protests.
- **Remote Areas**: Stay in touch with your group while hiking, camping, or in areas with no cell service.
- **Classrooms or Offices**: Set up a quick, local communication channel for a specific room or building.
- **Privacy-Focused Communication**: Chat with others without leaving a digital footprint on a centralized server.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation
