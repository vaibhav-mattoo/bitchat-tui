## üöÄ Quick Start

Launch the BitChat TUI client directly from your terminal:

```
bitchat-tui
```

The app will immediately start scanning for other BitChat users. Once a peer is found, it will connect automatically and you'll be placed in the `#public` chat room.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you see "Found bitchat service! Connecting..." but the device doesn't respond in time, you can retry the connection by pressing `r` on the error screen, or exit with `Ctrl+C` and run the app again.

Type messages in the input box and press `Enter` to send. Use `/help` to see a list of all available commands.

## üéÆ TUI Navigation & Interface

### Navigation & Chat Switching

#### Switching Between Conversations
- **Public Chat**: Select "Public" in the sidebar to return to the main public chat room.
- **Channels**: Select any channel name in the "Channels" section of the sidebar to switch to that channel.
- **Direct Messages**: Select a user's name in the "People" section to start or continue a DM conversation.

#### Sidebar Sections
- **Public**: The main public chat room where all users can see your messages.
- **Channels**: List of channels you've joined. Click to switch to a channel.
- **People**: List of online users. Click to start a private DM conversation.
- **Blocked**: Users you've blocked (if any).

### Notification System

The TUI provides several visual indicators to keep you informed:

#### Unread Message Indicators
- **Channel Badges**: Channels with unread messages show a count in the sidebar.
- **User Badges**: Users with unread DMs show a count next to their name.
- **Section Counters**: Each sidebar section shows total unread messages.

#### Status Indicators
- **Connection Status**: Shows "Connected" or "Connecting" in the status bar.
- **Current Chat**: Displays the active conversation name in the status bar.
- **Message Status**: Visual feedback when messages are sent successfully.

#### Visual Feedback
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different message types (public, channel, DM).
- **Highlighting**: Selected items in the sidebar are highlighted.
- **Scroll Position**: Visual indicator shows your position in the message history.

## üîê Cryptography & Security

BitChat is built with security and privacy as a first principle. All communication is protected by a modern cryptographic stack.

### Key Exchange
- **X25519**: Ephemeral keys are generated for each session. The X25519 algorithm is used for an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to establish a secure, shared secret with each peer.

### Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**: All messages (public, channel, and DM) are encrypted using AES in Galois/Counter Mode with a 256-bit key derived from the shared secret. This provides both confidentiality and integrity.

### Authentication
- **Ed25519**: Each peer generates an ephemeral Ed25519 key pair to sign communications, ensuring that messages are authentic and originate from the claimed sender.

### Channel Passwords
- **PBKDF2-SHA256**: When you set a password for a channel, a symmetric key is derived from it using PBKDF2 with 100,000 rounds of HMAC-SHA256, making it computationally difficult to brute-force.

## üéØ Use Cases

BitChat is perfect for any situation where you need to communicate without relying on internet infrastructure. This TUI client makes it easy to use BitChat from any terminal environment.
- **Public Events**: Create a local chat network at concerts, festivals, or protests.
- **Remote Areas**: Stay in touch with your group while hiking, camping, or in areas with no cell service.
- **Classrooms or Offices**: Set up a quick, local communication channel for a specific room or building.
- **Privacy-Focused Communication**: Chat with others without leaving a digital footprint on a centralized server.
- **Terminal-Only Environments**: Perfect for servers, embedded systems, or minimalist computing setups.
